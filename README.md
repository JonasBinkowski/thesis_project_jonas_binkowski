==============================

This is the code for my Bachelor Thesis "Leveraging Transformers for Anomaly Detection in Temporal Edge Attributed Multigraphs".

I'm using external code which is not written by me from: https://github.com/yule-BUAA/DyGLib_TGB/tree/master/.
The external files are marked at the top. Changes I made to the external code are marked with comments starting with "CHANGED".

To train the model run the train_lightning_anomaly_detector.py file with corresponding arguments.
